<h2>Here is some information about the two CAD (Computer Aided Design) packages we use in class!</h2>




<h3><img src="autocadLogo.jpg" alt="AutoCAD Logo" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
&emsp;AutoCAD
</h3>



<p>AutoCAD was created to be the all-in-all for every person in every domain. Which means it allots you control over the most insignificant, or should I say minute, detail possible in order for you
to be in complete control of your design from top to bottom. But that subsequently brings about a learning curve. Also, in order for a user to be able to draft a mechanical part for instance, it is necessary for that
user to learn the ins and outs of all the features relevant. They also have a sense of how to write scripts along with the macro development if he/she needs to go beyond the simple click and drag technique of 
drawing and the tool-specific fundamentals involved.<br></p>

<h4>AutoCAD is not Team-Friendly</h4>

<p>Along with all this, the user also must have a complete know how of the file types and layering capabilities in order to understand the design handed to him/her from another designer when working in a team or as
part of a workforce where designs are often shared and multiple versions of the same part are incorporated for trial purposes. Such wide-scale efforts varying in diversity can only be successfully delivered when
each one of the team members has a firm grip of all design fundamentals as well as the software’s features.<br></p>

<h4>AutoCAD and 3D</h4>

<p>But there are a few limitations to AutoCAD as well. Due to the fact that AutoCAD was primarily 2D software and was fine tuned into 3D software, it lacks features that other 3D modeling software incorporate almost
by default. AutoCAD does not have many modeling capabilities that can be found in SolidWorks or CATIA. It lacks dynamic simulations as well as cable and harness modules. Routed systems are yet to be
incorporated to their fullest capabilities and software’s such as CATIA offer advanced surfacing capabilities in a much more effective manner. You check our 3D AutoCAD tips, tools, and tutorials.<br></p>

<p>One last point of consideration is that AutoCAD is still alive mostly because of companies whose initial investments in old drawings force them to stay with AutoCAD. Otherwise, AutoCAD, according to industry
standards is at best 2D modeling and documentation software and a training ground for those looking to get into 3D development. Be it Inventor or CATIA or SolidWorks, AutoCAD is not the most suitable 3D
modeling/production software out there today.<br></p>




<h3><img src="InventorLogo.png" alt="Inventor Logo" style="width:100px;height:100px;">
&emsp;Inventor
</h3>




<p>On the other hand, Inventor is for the manufacturing phase. Where AutoCAD was developed on a geometry-driven design, Inventor was developed on a dimension-driven design. This basically means a huge
difference in the fundamentals enabling us to draw out a sketch and then manipulate it by tweaking the dimensions, as opposed to sketching a part with diligent control over aesthetics as well size and hoping that
we end up on the right form and shape.<br></p>

<h4>Drawing is simple with Inventor</h4>

<p>Using Inventor, drawing is simpler and more powerful, since all you need to do is sketch a raw form for the object, before finalizing its dimensions. Another excellent quality of Inventor is its ability to distinguish
features from within a part and store them as individuals in the part/feature browser. Which means if you don’t like the hole you put in place previously in your design, then you can simply select the hole from the
browser instead of having to tear the entire part away piece by piece. What is better is that the old habit of delete and repeat the design of the part goes out the window, and if you want to change a feature, you just
change the dimension.<br></p>

<h4>Supports Adaptation</h4>

<p>Following all this, Inventor even supports adaption. That means the existing geometry knows how to update itself based on updates within the base part of the geometry. Not only was this base-part proportionality
not available in AutoCAD, it was cumbersome to say the least to see that a part may or may not update itself when existing geometry would be manipulated. This is where the delete and repeat technique got birth
from. Another great thing about Inventor is that it doesn’t use layers, or a command line, or a UCSISON. This may sound like I’m pro-Inventor but the truth is that Inventor presents many opportunities that AutoCAD
just doesn’t touch upon, one of them is user-friendliness.<br></p>
